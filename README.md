# Computational-Reproducibility
CIS602-01 Project

Project based on reproducing of an already existing computational research work.

Research paper chosen for this project was Spectral Matting.

Execution of runAll.m file
In order to execute the runAll.m file, which generates or reproduces all the images from the paper, it is required that all the input images and image scribbles are in the same folder as runAll.m file. In the spectralMattingCode folder, all the input images have been placed, it simply requires to run the runAll.m file in Matlab 7 or later.
